# Assembler for Sedra Processor an 8 bit processor

#### *Please Note that Sedra processor is based on Sedra Quattro Architecture where any instruction consists of four words if you miss a single word this raises an error and the app notifies you of the violation*

### Here is the instruction set :
*  ADD INSTRUCTION : addar (destination register) (first operand register) (second operand register)
*  Subtract INSTRUCTION : subar (destination register) (first operand register) (second operand register) 
* And INSTRUCTION : mullog (destination register) (first operand register) (second operand register) 
*  Or INSTRUCTION : addlog (destination register) (first operand register) (second operand register) 

## Instructions start with 

```
start SEDRA16 asm session
```
## Instructions end with

```
end SEDRA16 asm session
```
